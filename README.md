# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project predicts student academic performance using **Multiple Linear Regression** in Python.  
It analyzes how different factors like study hours, attendance, and previous scores affect the final result.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Build a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Understand the impact of multiple features on student performance
- Train the model using both:
  - scikit-learn
- Evaluate the model using:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 🧠 Concept Used

Multiple Linear Regression:

Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ

Where:
- Y = Predicted Performance (Score/Grade)
- X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ = Input Features
- β₀ = Intercept
- β₁...βₙ = Coefficients

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains student-related features such as:

- Study Hours  
- Attendance  
- Previous Exam Score  
- Assignments Completed  
- Final Score (Target)
